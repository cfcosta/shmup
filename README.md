# Shmup Prototype

This is a game prototype I'm creating to test some stuff I'm learning about C and GameDev. Don't expect it to be complete, playable or even compilable.

## Installing

The only platform I'm currently supporting is Mac OS X, since it's the platform I use for development.

You'll need homebrew, with SDL and SDL_Image installed. The paths for aclocal need to be configured too. You can do it with this script:

```sh
brew install sdl sdl_image
sudo "echo $(brew --prefix)/share/aclocal >> /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist"
```

With SDL and SDL_Image installed, you can build it by running `./bootstrap.sh`.
